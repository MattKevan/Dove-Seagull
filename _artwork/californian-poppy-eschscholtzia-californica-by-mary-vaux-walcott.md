Known as the &#39;Audubon of Botany&#39;, Mary Vaux Walcott (1860–1940) was a female American artist and naturalist known for her almost a thousand watercolours of North American wildflowers. 

She started experimenting with painting flowers at the age of eight and during her family summer trips to the Rocky Mountains of Canada, she developed her interest in botany and painting.

As a remarkable botanist artist and an unconventional woman, she was elected as the president of the Society of Woman Geographers in 1933.
