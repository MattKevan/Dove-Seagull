This is the fifth in the &#39;Kleine Welten (Small Worlds)&#39; series of 12 prints, published in 1922, shortly after Kandinsky started teaching at the Bauhaus. It comprises of four woodcut prints, four etchings and four lithographs, each piece tailored to the medium&#39;s unique characteristics.

Born in 1866, Vasily Kandinsky taught at the Bauhaus and is credited with creating one of the first abstract artworks.
