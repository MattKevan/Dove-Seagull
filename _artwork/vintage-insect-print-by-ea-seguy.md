This is the first plate from a collection of stunning insect prints by EA Seguy.

EA Seguy was an artist and designer active in Paris during the first three decades of the 20th century. Very little is known about him, even his actual name and birth/death dates are in dispute. 

Seguy produced eleven albums of nature themed illustrations and patterns, drawing inspiration from papillons and other insects, flowers, foliage, crystals and animals. Seguy was one of few artists that successfully combined both Art Deco and Art Nouveau styles in his work. His brightly colored geometric patterns were intended to be used as inspiration for such decorative items as textiles and wallpaper.
