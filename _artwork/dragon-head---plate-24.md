Physostegia Virginiana. Virginian False Dragon-head. Stem, with leaves, enlarged 15 times

This is a print of plate 24 from Karl Blossfeldt&#39;s groundbreaking work &#39;Urformen der Kunst&#39;, first published in 1928. An English edition was published in 1929 as &#39;Art Forms in Nature&#39;. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld &quot;has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world&quot;. 

### Printing

Prints are available in a range of sizes, with a white border around the edges to allow for easy framing. If you have a specific size requirement, get in touch – we&#39;re always happy to help.
