&quot;The difficulty of making accurate drawings of objects as minute as many of the Algae and Confera, has induced me to avail myself of Sir John Herschel&#39;s beautiful process of Cyanotype, to obtain impressions of the plants themselves,&quot;

Anna Atkins (1799-1871) was an amateur botanist especially interested in scientific illustration and taxonomy. Her goal in producing Photographs of British Algae was to provide a visual companion to William Harvey&#39;s pioneering but unillustrated 1841 publication Manual of British Algae.

This book is a landmark in the histories both of photography and of publishing: the first photographic work by a woman, and the first book produced entirely by photographic means.
