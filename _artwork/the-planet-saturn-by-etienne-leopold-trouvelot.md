Incredible astronomical drawing by Étienne Léopold Trouvelot (1827–1895). 

Trouvelot was a self-taught astronomer and made these illustrations using various kinds of telescopes, including one at the Harvard College Observatory. His work set the standard for astronomical illustration up until the invention of the photographic dry-plate.
