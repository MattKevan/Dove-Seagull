Be Kind to Books Club – a carefully restored version of a poster commissioned by the WPA Federal Art Project, a scheme by the US Government to fund the visual arts from 1935-1943.

Prints are available in a variety of sizes, with a white border around the edges to allow for easy framing. If you have a specific size requirement, get in touch – we&#39;re always happy to help.

We use 200gsm enhanced matt art paper, an extremely high quality paper with a lovely texture, which looks fantastic and brings out the best in your artwork. With care, your print will look fantastic for many years!

When posting, we&#39;ll carefully pack your prints in a mailing tube or stiff envelope to keep them safe, and we aim have them on their way to you within 3-7 days of receiving your payment.

Please note that the actual item colours shown may be different from the photos above due to different monitor settings, and the frame shown is for illustrative purposes only.
