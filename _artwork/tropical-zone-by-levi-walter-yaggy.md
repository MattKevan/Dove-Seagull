Yaggy&#39;s large geographical charts are among the most beautiful and impressive educational charts published in the 19th century. 

Using chromolithography, Yaggy created stunning colors and contrasts in his images of the world, its regions, and peoples. The ten charts in this set were originally housed in a large wooden portfolio that also served as a display mechanism, allowing the charts to be tilted up for classroom use.
