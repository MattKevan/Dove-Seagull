Prints are available in a range of sizes, with a white border around the edges to allow for easy framing. If you have a specific size requirement, get in touch â€“ we&#39;re always happy to help.

We use 200gsm enhanced matt art paper, an extremely high quality paper with a lovely texture, which looks fantastic and brings out the best in your artwork. With care, your print will look fantastic for many years!

When posting, we&#39;ll carefully pack your prints in a mailing tube or stiff envelope to keep them safe, and we aim have them on their way to you within 3-7 days of receiving your payment.
