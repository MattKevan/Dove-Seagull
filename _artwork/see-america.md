A classic 1930s American travel poster design. This is a carefully restored print of a poster commissioned by the WPA Federal Art Project, a scheme by the US Government to fund the visual arts from 1935-1943.

By purchasing this print, you can own a piece of American art history!

Prints are available in a range of sizes, with a white border around the edges to allow for easy framing. If you have a specific size requirement, get in touch â€“ we&#39;re always happy to help.

We use 200gsm enhanced matt art paper, an extremely high quality paper with a lovely texture, which looks fantastic and brings out the best in your artwork. With care, your print will look fantastic for many years!
