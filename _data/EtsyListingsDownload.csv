"Compass Plant - Plate 41 | Urformen der Kunst | Karl Blossfeldt | Botanical print, wall art, room decor, black & white, sepia, vintage","Silphium Laciniatum. Compass Plant. Leaf dried on the stem enlarged 5 times.

This is a print of plate 41 from Karl Blossfeldt's groundbreaking work 'Urformen der Kunst', first published in 1928. An English edition was published in 1929 as 'Art Forms in Nature'. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld ""has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world"". 

### Printing

Prints are available in a range of sizes, with a white border around the edges to allow for easy framing. If you have a specific size requirement, get in touch – we're always happy to help.

We use 200gsm enhanced matt art paper, an extremely high quality paper with a lovely texture, which looks fantastic and brings out the best in your artwork. With care, your print will look fantastic for many years!

"And God Set Them in the Heavens | Genesis Bible print, Paul Nash |  Woodcut engraving, art, Bible, high quality print, black & white","This is the seventh in an amazing series of woodcut prints by Paul Nash, illustrating the first chapter of Genesis.

""And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.""

Paul Nash (11 May 1889 – 11 July 1946) was a British surrealist painter and war artist, as well as a photographer, writer and designer of applied art. Nash was among the most important landscape artists of the first half of the twentieth century. He played a key role in the development of Modernism in English art.

The prints in this set were first published in 1924 by Nonesuch Press as 'Genesis – Twelve woodcuts by Paul Nash with the first chapter of Genesis in the Authorised Version'.

"American Maiden-Hair Fern - Plate 55 | From Urformen Der Kunst by Karl Blossfeldt | Vintage botanical photographic print","American Maiden-Hair Fern (Adiantum Pedatum). Young fronds enlarged eight times. Plate 55.

This is a print from Karl Blossfeldt's groundbreaking work 'Urformen der Kunst' first published in 1928. A 1929 English edition was published as 'Art Forms in Nature'. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld 'has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world’.

Vaccinium Corymbosum. Common or Swamp Blueberry. Bunch of fruit enlarged 8 times. Polystichum Falcatum. Prickly Shield-fern. Young rolled-up frond enlarged 5 times.

This is a print of plate 33 from Karl Blossfeldt's groundbreaking work 'Urformen der Kunst', first published in 1928. An English edition was published in 1929 as 'Art Forms in Nature'. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld ""has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world"".

"Let the waters bring forth abundantly Genesis print | Paul Nash |  Woodcut engraving, art, Bible, high quality print, black & white","This is the eighth in an amazing series of woodcut prints by Paul Nash, illustrating the first chapter of Genesis.

""And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.""

Paul Nash (11 May 1889 – 11 July 1946) was a British surrealist painter and war artist, as well as a photographer, writer and designer of applied art. Nash was among the most important landscape artists of the first half of the twentieth century. He played a key role in the development of Modernism in English art.

The prints in this set were first published in 1924 by Nonesuch Press as 'Genesis – Twelve woodcuts by Paul Nash with the first chapter of Genesis in the Authorised Version'.

Chrysanthemum leucanthemum. Ox-eye Daisy. Flower-bud enlarged 16 times.

This is a print of plate 28 from Karl Blossfeldt's groundbreaking work 'Urformen der Kunst', first published in 1928. An English edition was published in 1929 as 'Art Forms in Nature'. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld ""has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world"". 

### Printing

Prints are available in a range of sizes, with a white border around the edges to allow for easy framing. If you have a specific size requirement, get in touch – we're always happy to help.

We use 200gsm enhanced matt art paper, an extremely high quality paper with a lovely texture, which looks fantastic and brings out the best in your artwork. With care, your print will look fantastic for many years!

"Arbor Vitae – Plate 67 | From Urformen Der Kunst by Karl Blossfeldt | Vintage botanical photographic print","Arbor Vitae and Common Rue, enlarged 10 times.

This is a print from Karl Blossfeldt's groundbreaking work 'Urformen der Kunst', first published in 1928. An English edition was published in 1929 as 'Art Forms in Nature'. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld ""has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world"".

"Winter Horsetail - Plate 2 | Art Forms in Nature by Karl Blossfeldt | Botanical print, wall art, room decor, black & white, sepia, vintage","Equisetum Hiemale. Winter Horsetail: enlarged 12 times.
Equisetum Maximum. Fox-tailed Asparagus: enlarged 4 times.
Equisetum Hiemale. Winter Horsetail: enlarged 18 times.

This is a print from Karl Blossfeldt's groundbreaking work 'Urformen der Kunst', first published in 1928. An English edition was published in 1929 as 'Art Forms in Nature'. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld ""has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world"".

This is a print of plate 31 from Karl Blossfeldt's groundbreaking work 'Urformen der Kunst', first published in 1928. An English edition was published in 1929 as 'Art Forms in Nature'. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld ""has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world"".

"Let There Be Lights in the Firmament by Paul Nash | Genesis woodcut print","This is the sixth in an amazing series of woodcut prints by Paul Nash, illustrating the first chapter of Genesis.

""And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.""

Paul Nash (11 May 1889 – 11 July 1946) was a British surrealist painter and war artist, as well as a photographer, writer and designer of applied art. Nash was among the most important landscape artists of the first half of the twentieth century. He played a key role in the development of Modernism in English art.

The prints in this set were first published in 1924 by Nonesuch Press as 'Genesis – Twelve woodcuts by Paul Nash with the first chapter of Genesis in the Authorised Version'.

"Arbor Vitae - Plate 29 | From Urformen Der Kunst by Karl Blossfeldt | Vintage botanical photographic print","Thujopsis Dolabrata. Hatchet-Leaved Arbor Vitae. Ends of a branch enlarged 10 times.

This is a print of plate 29 from Karl Blossfeldt's groundbreaking work 'Urformen der Kunst', first published in 1928. An English edition was published in 1929 as 'Art Forms in Nature'. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld ""has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world"".

"Indian Balsam - Plate 19 | Urformen der Kunst | Karl Blossfeldt | Botanical print, wall art, room decor, black & white, sepia, vintage","Impatiens glanduligera. Hardy Indian Balsam. Stem with ramifications: natural size.

This is a print of plate 19 from Karl Blossfeldt's groundbreaking work 'Urformen der Kunst', first published in 1928. An English edition was published in 1929 as 'Art Forms in Nature'. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld ""has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world"". 

### Printing

Prints are available in a range of sizes, with a white border around the edges to allow for easy framing. If you have a specific size requirement, get in touch – we're always happy to help.

We use 200gsm enhanced matt art paper, an extremely high quality paper with a lovely texture, which looks fantastic and brings out the best in your artwork. With care, your print will look fantastic for many years!

"Lime Mallow - Plate 103 | From Urformen Der Kunst by Karl Blossfeldt | Vintage botanical photographic print","Lime Mallow (Abutilon). Pod enlarged six times. Plate 103.

This is a high-quality print from Karl Blossfeldt's groundbreaking work 'Urformen der Kunst' first published in 1928. A 1929 English edition was published as 'Art Forms in Nature'. The complete work contains 120 rotary gravure plates, prefaced with an introductory text and list of subjects.

Karl Blossfeldt was a German teacher, sculptor and photographer celebrated by early modernists and the Surrealists for his pioneering close-up photography of plants and flora. Using a homemade camera and lens, he was able to magnify a subject 30 times, capturing the fine detail of his specimens.

The philosopher Walter Benjamin declared that Blossfeld 'has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world’.

"In the Midst of the Waters by Paul Nash – Genesis woodcut print","This is the third in an amazing series of woodcut prints by Paul Nash, illustrating the first chapter of Genesis.

""And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.""

Paul Nash (11 May 1889 – 11 July 1946) was a British surrealist painter and war artist, as well as a photographer, writer and designer of applied art. Nash was among the most important landscape artists of the first half of the twentieth century. He played a key role in the development of Modernism in English art.

The prints in this set were first published in 1924 by Nonesuch Press as 'Genesis – Twelve woodcuts by Paul Nash with the first chapter of Genesis in the Authorised Version'.
