Produced during a period when Nash regarded himself as ‘a war artist without a war’, it is now recognised as a high point in his artistic output and one of the most significant illustrated books of the twentieth century.

To accompany the Creation story described in the opening chapter of the Book of Genesis, Nash cut a series of twelve wood engravings of astonishing power. Starting with a solid black evocation of The Void, his stark images gradually emerge from primordial darkness into divine light, dynamic semi-abstract forms evoking the mystery of the appearance of the universe at God’s command.
