In the early 1560s, while secretary to the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I, Bocksay produced his Model Book of Calligraphy, showing off the wonderful range of writing style in his repertoire. 

Some 30 years later (and 15 years after the death of Bocskay), Ferdinandâ€™s grandson, who had inherited the book, commissioned Hoefnagel to add his delightful illustrations of flowers, fruits, and insects. It would prove to be, as The Getty, who now own the manuscript, commented, 'one of the most unusual collaborations between scribe and painter in the history of manuscript illumination'.
