title: Kleine Welten
lead: " Published in 1922, shortly after Vasily Kandinsky began teaching at the Bauhaus.
  As the artist explains in the portfolio's introduction, each technique was chosen
  for its unique character: etching is characterized by its precision and appropriateness
  to the study of lines; woodcut is marked by the interplay of foreground and background,
  and the richness of textures; lithography combines a range of markings and colors
  to produce an image that most closely approximates a painting. As evident in their
  titles, each print represents an autonomous microcosm, a reflection of Kandinsky's
  view of the world as a self-contained cosmic entity consisting of innumerable independent,
  hermetic units."
